# vino
List of wines I drunk.

I used to use the vivino app; some months ago it stopped working on my phone with the message "no internet available" which is false because I have plenty of internet available. 

vivino did not inform me of the fact they stopped the support for my phone... on the other hand I am receiving from vivinno a lot of unsolicited emails about "wine bargain", I think it is not a professional behaviour.
